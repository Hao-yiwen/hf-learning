      "last term is 100, which is even. So all terms are paired correctly. So 50 pairs, each of which is\n",
      "-1. So total sum is -50.  Wait, but let me check with a different approach. Maybe using the formula\n",
      "for the sum of an alternating series. The general formula for the sum from k=1 to n of (-1)^{k+1} k\n",
